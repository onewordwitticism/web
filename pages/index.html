            Welcome! This is my website about miscellaneous projects that I've (Matthew Feldman) worked on.  This webpage is going to be a log of
            my investigation into complex systems; with some basic software engineering and data analysis projects that take my fancy.  Hopefully, you might find some stuff cool.

        <h2>About me</h2>

        <article>
            <p>
                I've had a bit of a round-about education; first focusing on exercise and physiology which then branched out into some clinical motor-neuroscience research.  I think
                this is where my first interest for complex systems began, but unfortunately didn't have the programming or mathematics skills to really delve into the area like I wanted/want too.
                I made the leap, and went to study mathematics and programming, and now here I am logging my work whilst planning my next steps into the industry.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Maybe I got interested in complexity, or more that it was impressed on me, due to the area that I grew up in.
                South-East Queensland has some beautiful national parks and natural scenery, which can leave a strong impression on a young adult of the vastness and scale of ecological systems (See some photos here).
                It almost seems a shame, or a surprise, that a video game hasn't been produced using Australia's natural flora and fauna which is all quite unique.
            </p>

            <!--Another area of interest from a young age I've had is human psychology and decision making, and how these relate to communal politics.-->

            <p>
                Another interest I've developed recently is due to one thing I love; which is electronic music.  With the advent of the internet there it's opened the door to
                creators projecting their work out at scale, and there is a huge abundance of quality music which seemingly lacks visuals which tie into the music well.  Although
                complex, I'd love to attempt to create a somewhat automated system for creation of visual content.
